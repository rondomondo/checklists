## DevOps - What is

DevOps is a software development approach that combines development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten development cycles and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software. Key components include:

1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
3. Automated testing and monitoring
4. Collaboration between development and operations teams
5. Version control and configuration management
6. Cloud computing and containerization

DevOps practices help organizations deploy code more frequently and reliably while reducing time-to-market and improving system stability.

## SRE - What is

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline created by Google that applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations. SRE focuses on:

- Creating highly reliable and scalable systems
- Using automation to manage infrastructure
- Establishing error budgets and SLOs/SLIs
- Eliminating toil through automation
- Implementing monitoring, alerting, and incident response

While similar to DevOps, SRE is more prescriptive and emphasizes treating operations as a software problem.

## 9 Pillars of SRE

The 9 pillars of SRE foundation are:

1. Service Level Objectives (SLOs): Defining and measuring reliability targets

2. Error Budgets: Acceptable threshold for system failures based on SLOs

3. Monitoring and Alerting: Tracking system health and responding to issues

4. Capacity Planning: Ensuring adequate resources for system demands

5. Change Management: Controlling how and when systems are modified

6. Emergency Response: Procedures for handling incidents and outages

7. Toil Reduction: Automating repetitive operational tasks

8. Infrastructure as Code: Managing infrastructure through software principles

9. Postmortem Culture: Learning from incidents to prevent recurrence through blameless analysis
