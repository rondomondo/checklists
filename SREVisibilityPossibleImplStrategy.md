## Implementation Best Practices

### Resource Allocation
- Dedicate 20% of one SRE's time to visibility initiatives
- Rotate responsibilities monthly to reduce bordom and cross pollinate
- Use templates and automation wherever possible
- Leverage existing tools before building new ones - COTS

### Stakeholder Management
1. **Executive Sponsors**
   - Monthly 30-minute updates
   - Focus on business impact
   - Prepare 2-3 key metrics
   - Request specific support needed and feedback

2. **Development Teams**
   - Weekly informal syncs intra team and cross functional
   - Focus on practical benefits and solicit input
   - Share success stories
   - Gather feedback regularly

### Success Metrics Tracking
#### Weekly Metrics
- Newsletter/Webinar engagement rate
- Office hours attendance
- Wiki page views
- Comms/Slack channel activity

#### Monthly Metrics
- Training completion rates
- Incident reduction
- Cross-team collaboration instances
- Internal Customer satisfaction scores
- Anything else out of band of note

## Risk Management

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overcommitting**
   - Solution: Start with 2-3 initiatives max
   - Review capacity monthly
   - Expect and be willing to pause or adjust and advertise this possability

2. **Loss of Momentum**
   - Solution: Celebrate small wins
   - Regular progress updates
   - Rotate responsibilities
   - Keep content fresh - VIP

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Solution: Use templates
   - Automate repetitive tasks
   - Leverage existing tools - COTS
   - Share responsibilities

### Quick Recovery Actions
- Keep backup plans for key initiatives
- Document lessons learned regularly
- Have contingency resources identified in advance
- Maintain stakeholder communication - VIP
